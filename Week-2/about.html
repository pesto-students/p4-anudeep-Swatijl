                <h3 class="highlight-color">About me</h3>
                Hey, it's nice to meet you. I am <strong class="highlight-color">Swati</strong> from India. I spend my days tapping on keyboards
                and Googling
                stuff. Like, all day. I like reading official docs of any language. I am trying to get some good hands
                on data structure & algorithm(failing badly). I got really impressed with blockchains & crypto & yeah,
                like everyone, I had also invested in it & had a huge loss. Now I believe nothing is going "to the
                moon". Apart from coding, on weekends, I like to sketch, you can visit my page on Instagram <a class="highlight-color"

                    <h3 class="highlight-color">What I do</h3>
                    <p>So yeah, I am a software developer by profession, so I do coding all day. That sounds boring,
                        right? Let me make it more interesting for you to read. If someone comes to me & ask any of
                        these question -
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How can I expand my business?</li>
                        <li>How can I manage employees data working in my organization?</li>
                        <li>How to make my local shop more popular among different regions?</li>
                        <li>How can I get a date for next valentine's?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        All these problems & many more have one solution i.e. a software. There's nothing in
                        this world that
                        cannot be resolved through a software. That's another reason I chose software industry. </p>

                    <h3 class="highlight-color">How I do it</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let's come to - how I will develop a web application for you. So, my approach is to start with
                        understanding the problem statement very well. I will ask you a lot of questions before actual
                        development, so bear with me. Once the requirement is clear, I start developing the application.
                        I take suggestions for the look & feel if you have any, otherwise I use my approach (just google
                        some good templates & add its html/css with few changes). I am good at backend, so no worries
                        in that part. I mainly focuse on how I can make the application more secure (oh yeah, you
                        cannot mess up with the security part). And the tech stack I work on - Js frameworks(frontend),
                        Django(backend) & some Databases.

                    <h3 class="highlight-color">Why I do it</h3>
                    <p>
                        I develop software because I love coding & through my skill, I can solve real-world
                        problems. And yeah, money is also an important factor. I am really getting paid well for what I
                        do.
